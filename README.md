## Getting Started

Welcome to my first demo on Github. In this demo, I have just implemented a generic Singly Linked List data structure that can accept any non-primitive data types. The Linked List is implemented with some basic operations:

- Calculating the current length of the list.
- Inserting an element to the list.
- Deleting an element from the list.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
